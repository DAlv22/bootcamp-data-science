# Beta Bank Churn Prediction Project

## Project Description

This project aims to present a model that can help Beta Bank predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon.

## Overview

The project involves building a predictive model to identify customers who are at risk of churning. By analyzing historical customer data and contract termination records, the model will predict the likelihood of a customer leaving the bank in the near future. This will enable Beta Bank to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.
