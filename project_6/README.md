# Zuber Project: Analysis of Passenger Preferences and External Factors in Ridesharing

The present project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis for the ridesharing company Zuber. The goal is to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.

## Project Objective

The main objective is to delve into the behavior of Zuber's passengers, identifying patterns and trends in their travel preferences. Additionally, we will analyze how various external factors, such as weather, time of day, and local events, influence the demand for ridesharing services.

## Methodology

To carry out this analysis, a combination of data processing and analysis techniques will be used. Statistical and visualization tools will be employed to explore the collected datasets. It is important to note that the data used in this project was previously obtained through data extraction using SQL.

## Expected Results

We expect to gain a detailed understanding of Zuber's passenger preferences, as well as a comprehensive assessment of the impact of external factors on ridesharing service demand. The findings of this analysis will provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making within the company, enabling service offerings improvement and user experience optimization.
