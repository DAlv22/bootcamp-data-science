# Gold Extraction Optimization

## Description
Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra, a company developing efficiency solutions for heavy industry. The model aims to predict the quantity of gold extracted from gold ore based on extraction and purification data. By optimizing production and eliminating unprofitable parameters, the model will enhance operational efficiency.

## Project Objective
Develop a machine learning model to predict the quantity of gold extracted from ore. The model will assist in optimizing production processes and identifying unprofitable parameters.

## Data
The dataset includes extraction and purification data relevant to gold extraction. This data will be used to train and evaluate the machine learning model.
