# Age Verification System

## Project Description
Develop a computer vision model to automatically verify the age of customers in the checkout area, aiming to prevent the sale of alcohol to underage individuals.

## Objective
Build a computer vision model using information from cameras placed in the checkout area to verify the age of customers.

Ensure your image data is organized in the appropriate directory structure for training and validation.

The dataset is stored in the /datasets/faces/ folder:

The final_files folder contains 7600 photos.
The labels.csv file contains labels with two columns: file_name and real_age.
Given the large number of image files, it is recommended to avoid reading them all at once to prevent high computational resource consumption.
