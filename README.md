# Bootcamp Data Science
The data science bootcamp was conducted using a study and work approach divided into sprints. After learning the theory, participants applied a simulator, and finally developed their own projects. These projects are designed to simulate real-world problems encountered by data scientists.

Below are some of the projects I worked on during the bootcamp.
