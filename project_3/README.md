# Megaline Telecom Analysis

## Objective

Megaline, a telecommunications company, offers two prepaid plans: Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department seeks to determine which plan generates more revenue to adjust the advertising budget effectively.

A preliminary analysis of the plans is conducted based on data from a relatively small customer sample of 500 individuals. The dataset includes customer profiles, plan usage, call records, text messages, and internet usage for the year 2018.

The analysis aims to understand customer behavior and identify which prepaid plan yields higher revenue.
